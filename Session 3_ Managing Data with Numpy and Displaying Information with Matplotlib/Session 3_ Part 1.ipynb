You add the finishing touches, press Run and ... nothing. After 30 seconds of your laptop sounding like a jet engine a wall of red text appears in the console. As you scroll through this text, you have no idea where or how to start fixing your code. Dejected, you close your laptop and make this tomorrow's problem.*\n","\n","Sound familiar? While a touch dramatic, code failing to run as expected is an incredibly common issue that coders run into. And unlike attempting to find a new method or library to actualise an idea you've had, Google isn't always able to offer solutions to repair your code. The reasons why are likely a combination of:\n","\n","\n","*   you aren't sure what the problem is, so you don't know what to search.\n","*   you have identified the symptoms of the problem, but not the root (see above point).\n","*   you do know what the problem is, but there are no search results that *exactly* match your issue.\n","\n","\n","As we continue through this section, we hope to give you some tools and techniques that you can immediately implement into your workflow. For clarity, we will try to separate these tips into two types. Firstly, we have the **preventative** coding habits that aim to minimise simple errors; such errors can of course compound to make for nasty debugging if left alone. Secondly, we have **reactive** habits, which can be your go-to options for when your code has failed to Run. However, before we get too far ahead of ourselves...\n","\n","# What is an error?\n","This isn't as trivial a question as it sounds. A **programming error** means an error which occurs during the development or encoding of a computer program, software, or application, which would, when in operation, result in a malfunction or incorrect operation of a computer network. At this stage, we only want you to know of the three main types of error you will encounter:\n","\n","*   **Syntax** - your code doesn't follow the syntax (language) rules of your programming language. This error is likely caught by the IDE during Run.\n","*   **Runtime** - an error which takes place during the running of your program. This is likely to result in a crash mid-process.\n","*   **Logic** - your program runs but gives unexpected outputs. This will often only be apparent when you analyse the outputs of your program.\n","\n","We will explore these errors, and ways to handle them, in more detail as we continue through our example.\n","\n","# Our Example\n","\n","As part of a coding project, you need to create a function to conduct mathematical operations upon a user's input. You create the following pseudocode flow chart:\n","\n","1.   Take in user's input when the function is invoked (called).\n","2.   Square their input.\n","3.   Print the squared input to the user.\n","4.   Return the squared number to the wider program.\n","\n","An example function for this task might look something like below.\n","\n","Enter run the cell below and enter a nubmer (choose 1-10 for ease please).\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zMa49R4q7smu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def square_number():\n","    \"\"\"\n","    User-inputs a number to square\n","\n","    :return: Squared number\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    number_to_square = int(input(\"Enter a number to square: \"))\n","    squared_number = number_to_square ** number_to_square\n","\n","    return squared_number\n","\n","num = 0\n","# Do other stuff to num\n","num = square_number()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"y-eOT2la_mM5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1662292148088,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1810,"user":{"displayName":"Cameron McEleney","userId":"11849720894648742628"}},"outputId":"66686616-3d85-45bc-921d-fae283df99a7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Enter a number to square: 5\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ah.

Create each function to fulfil an explicit purpose, test each function once it has been in isolation, and then test the function in the context of the wider program. \n","\n","We likely left our program alone too long, and so now we need to localise issues; this method also works for breaking down an individual component, as we shall do here. The simplest, and often fastest to implement, debugging approach is **Debug By Breakpoint**. What we want to do is create multiple stages to return information, allowing us to track the values held in data structures and variables.

we have here is our first encounter with a Runtime error; something preventing our code from running, but not from compiling. The text in red is the specific error raised by Python, and the short description is intended to help you (the coder) diagnose the problem. Further up you'll see line numbers which are directing you to the code-line where the failure occurred. \n","\n","Your first port-of-call might well be \"Copy the error into Goggle', and that's not a bad suggestion. However, before you go searching StackOverflow for hours, take some time to look back through your code and the error message. Fortunately, this one is short and straightforward (many are horrifying). The above ValueError can be translated loosely as\n","\n","> A constant value that is an integer in the base 10 system is invalid: 0.7. This happened on line 8 (green arrow) \n","\n","We know from maths that 0.7 is indeed not an integer, and so our first option is actually to look at Line8 as our problem location. We can see that we cast from a **string** (input() returns a string) to an **int**, so what happens if we change that line to \n","\n","`number_to_square = float(input(\"Enter a number to square: \"))`\n","\n","Well, now the code works for floats but not for ints! What we have here is an instance where we want the code to conduct a test, and then choose the correct option depending on (in this case) the input. If **if statements** are coming to mind, then fantastic!
