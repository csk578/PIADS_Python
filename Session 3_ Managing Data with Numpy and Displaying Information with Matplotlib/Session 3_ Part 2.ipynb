The package is also the basis of more complex graphical display packages such as 'seaborn' and allows a high degree of control over figure display and formatting. \n","\n","# Task 3.2\n","\n","Micromagnetic simulations can be used to model the behaviour of magnetic materials. Like many simulation tools, they are useful for predicting and verifing theoretical concepts with experimental results and are used extensively throughout the magnetics community. One of the outputs of these models are measurements of magnetisation as a function of applied magnetic field. From this, it is possible to plot hysteresis loops and extract information such as the coercive field (H$_{c}$) and saturation magnetisation (M$_{s}$).\n","\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Z1Yp2S-q0iYummBFe7YuUlUDxcdhNOE_' width=30%>\n","\n","The task here is to bring together the concepts from previous sessions and use them to analyse some magnetic materials.
